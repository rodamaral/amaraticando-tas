# Rambi Rumble Wrong Warp

## First descent

- there're only 3 possible positions for this trick
- despawn the Kutlass without going too much to the right
- go back without pressing Y, as slow speeds minimize the odds of bad positions (95% of success if you train)
- looking at the tip of the knife against the background seems to be a good way to differenciate between the pixels
- the more to the left, the later you must jump
- pausing to see the pixels might be a good idea, before you master your eyes
- always do maximum jumps
- the X position of the gif is a good position
- the Kutlass should visually fall very fast

This is the most likely in my experience.
